# Spotify Album Shuffler

See a live version of this app [here](https://kassettenwechsler.de). Current build status:

[![Deployment on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/b0wter/shuffler-frontend/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/b0wter/shuffler-frontend/actions/workflows/build.yml)

The web app give you (random) recommendations from a previously defined pool of artists/playlists from Spotify. You can put in as many artists/playlists as you like and switch them on the fly.

## Usage
This project requires some tooling/data that is not yet publicly available. I am working on changing that.
