# Spotify Album Shuffler

See a live version of this app [here](https://kassettenwechsler.de). Current build status:

[![Deployment on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/b0wter/shuffler-frontend/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/b0wter/shuffler-frontend/actions/workflows/build.yml)

The web app give you (random) recommendations from a previously defined pool of artists/playlists from Spotify and other music streaming services. You can put in as many artists/playlists as you like and switch them on the fly.

## Building
This project is not configurable in the usual sense. Artists/albums/playlists are generated by source generators and compiled into a release. The reason for that is that it allows the web app to be served without any form of backend service. All data is baked into the web app itself.

To be able to build the repository you will first need to generate Elm source files containing all the meta data. Check the following repository [Tools](https://github.com/AlbumShuffler/DataRetrieverNet) for tools that retrieve data from the music streaming services and generate ELm source files.

This repository contains a `local-build` bash script that does all the heavy lifting. Use it like this:
```
./local-build $spotify_client_id $spotify_client_secret $path_to_input_file
```
The `id` and `secret` are given to you by Spotify after creating an integration using their [api](https://developer.spotify.com/).
You will need to write the input file yourself.
Its content and structure is described in [the data retriever repository](https://developer.spotify.com/).

After running the build all you need to do is to put the contents of the `dist` folder on a web server.
Since all content is baked into the app there is no need for any backend service.
